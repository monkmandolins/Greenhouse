Thank you for sharing the Amazon link to your ESP32-2432S028 development board. This board, often referred to as the "Cheap Yellow Display" (CYD), integrates a 2.8" TFT touchscreen and is based on the ESP32-WROOM-32 module. While it offers several GPIO pins for peripheral connections, some are pre-assigned to onboard components, which can limit their availability for custom applications.

Note: Ensure that GPIO 16 and GPIO 17 are not being used by the onboard RGB LED in your application. If they are, you'll need to reassign or disable the RGB LED functionality.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations
GPIO 21: As it's connected to the TFT display's backlight, using this pin for other purposes can interfere with the display's operation.

GPIO 35: Being input-only, it's suitable for sensors but cannot be used to drive outputs like relays.

Power Requirements: Ensure that the total current drawn by the relays does not exceed the board's power supply capabilities. Use external power sources and opto-isolated relay modules if necessary.
